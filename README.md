# anylinuxfs
An easy way to mount ext4, btrfs or in fact any linux-supported filesystem on a Mac.
With full write support, based on the libkrun microVM hypervisor and NFS. Doesn't require installing any kernel extensions or lowering system security.

If you like the project, you can support it on Ko-fi. Right now with the release of macOS Tahoe, I'm looking to purchase additional testing hardware as it is otherwise a bit tricky to test virtualization with multiple OS versions (nested virtualization support is still limited).

## Features
- mounts any filesystem supported by Linux (**ext4**, **btrfs**, **xfs**, ... but also **NTFS** and **exFAT**)
- supports **LUKS**-encrypted drives
- supports **BitLocker**-encrypted drives â€“ **NTFS** or **FAT32** (using your recovery key as passphrase)
- supports **LVM** (even volume groups spanning multiple drives)
- supports **LVM on LUKS** (i.e. encrypted LVM)
- supports **Linux RAID** (mdadm) and **multi-disk btrfs**
- works with both external and internal drives
- works with disk images
- supports disks with **GPT**, **MBR** or no partition table (single filesystem or LVM/LUKS container)
- NFS share by default only reachable from localhost but can be shared across network too
- define your own [custom actions](#custom-actions) (e.g. mount **borg backup** located on a Linux drive)

## Introduction

Mounting 3rd-party filesystems on macOS has always been tricky. There's official support for reading NTFS but otherwise we've mainly used solutions based on macFUSE.
We've got NTFS-3g which is a pretty mature driver but for Linux filesystems there's only a couple of experimental solutions like [fuse-ext2](https://github.com/alperakcan/fuse-ext2) or [ext4fuse](https://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse).

If you want a reliable solution with write access, you need to run a Linux virtual machine with physical disk access and take care of exposing the mounted filesystem to the host.
This is exactly what `anylinuxfs` does and it streamlines it so that it's as easy as running one command in terminal.

You pick a drive, mount it with `anylinuxfs` and it appears as a NFS share on localhost. This spins up a microVM in the background which uses the real linux drivers, so you can access anything from `ext*` to `btrfs`. Any mount options on the command-line will be forwarded to the linux mount command, so you can mount read-only, read-write, pick btrfs subvolumes, etc. Then you simply eject the drive in Finder or use `umount` in terminal and the virtual machine will be turned off.

This all sounds like a lot of work but it's actually very fast. Not like a traditional virtual machine which takes a while to boot.
This one is just a stripped down version of Linux, there's not even a UEFI firmware. Practically, it takes only a couple of seconds before the drive is mounted and ready to use.

## Basic usage

Most often, you will probably use the following commands:
* `anylinuxfs mount` - mount a filesystem; this is the default command, so the `mount` keyword can be omitted
* `anylinuxfs list` - show available Linux filesystems (alternatively, `anylinuxfs list -m` shows Microsoft filesystems)
* `anylinuxfs status` - show what is currently mounted
* `anylinuxfs log` - show details about the current (or last) run, useful for troubleshooting

### Mounting filesystems

From `anylinuxfs mount --help`:
```
Usage: anylinuxfs [mount] [OPTIONS] <DISK_IDENT> [MOUNT_POINT]

Arguments:
  <DISK_IDENT>   File path(s), LVM identifier or RAID identifier, e.g.:
                 /dev/diskXsY[:/dev/diskYsZ:...]
                 lvm:<vg-name>:diskXsY[:diskYsZ:...]:<lv-name>
                 raid:diskXsY[:diskYsZ:...]
                 (see `list` command output for available volumes)
  [MOUNT_POINT]  Custom mount path to override the default under /Volumes
```

* The only required parameter is the disk identifier.
* It must always refer to one or more partitions or logical volumes (not whole disks).
* Basic syntax of an identifier is `/dev/diskXsY` - based on how `anylinuxfs list` or `diskutil list` identifies your drives.
* If your filesystem is on a logical volume, you will usually need a special prefixed identifier starting with `lvm` or `raid` (for mdadm Linux RAID).
  These can be deduced from `anylinuxfs list` output where any logical volumes will be shown as synthesized disks (similar to how `diskutil` does it for APFS containers)
* In case of btrfs filesystems spanning multiple disks (like RAID1 or JBOD), these will not be grouped in the `anylinuxfs list` output.
* In order to mount a filesystem like this, you use the `/dev/diskXsY:/dev/diskYsZ` syntax. Basically, you must specify all partitions that need to be attached to our microVM so that they can be scanned for any multi-disk btrfs filesystems.

## Custom actions

With custom actions, you're able to define sets of scripts which will run inside the virtual machine at specific points.
Currently, you can run an action after a filesystem was mounted and also before it is unmounted (typically to do cleanup).
You can also override the path inside the virtual machine which gets shared with macOS via NFS. This is useful for mounting nested filesystems (from disk images, etc.).

Your custom actions can also depend on additional packages not included in the base Linux installation by default. `anylinuxfs` exposes the Alpine package manager for that purpose. That means it can maintain a list of extra packages installed by the user and reinstall them again when you reinit your Linux image (or when reinit is forced by `anylinuxfs` upgrade).

### Examples

#### Mount borg backup located on a Linux drive

For this, we will first need to install additional alpine packages:
```
anylinuxfs apk add borgbackup fuse py3-llfuse
```

Then we define a custom action by editing (or creating) `~/.anylinuxfs/config.toml`:
```
[custom_actions.borg]
after_mount = "mkdir -p /mnt/borg && borg mount $ALFS_VM_MOUNT_POINT/$BORG_REPO /mnt/borg"
before_unmount = "borg umount /mnt/borg && rmdir /mnt/borg"
override_nfs_export = "/mnt/borg"
```

You can refer to environment variables from custom actions. Those starting with `$ALFS_` are set by anylinuxfs. Any other variables must be set by the user.
If you want your custom action to use any other environment variable which is not explicitly used in the script (e.g. borg might use `$BORG_PASSPHRASE`), you can list them like this:
```
[custom_actions.borg]
after_mount = "..."
before_unmount = "..."
capture_environment = ["BORG_PASSPHRASE"]
override_nfs_export = "/mnt/borg"
```

To invoke your action when mounting a drive, use the `-a` flag:
```
export BORG_REPO=<path to borg repo relative to mount point>
anylinuxfs mount /dev/disk4s2 -a borg
```

You will be asked for your passphrase (if you haven't set `capture_environment` and exported `BORG_PASSPHRASE`) and your borg backup will be mounted instead of the whole Linux drive.

## Notes

### VM initialization
- When you first run `anylinuxfs` to mount a drive, it will download the alpine Linux image from Docker hub and unpack it to your user profile (`~/.anylinuxfs/alpine`).
Then it will spin up a VM so it can install dependencies and do the initial environment setup. After that, the Linux root filesystem will be reused for every mount operation.
You can also run `anylinuxfs init` to download a fresh copy of `alpine:latest` and reinitialize the environment at any time.

### Permissions
- It is needed to run mount commands with `sudo` otherwise we're not allowed direct access to `/dev/disk*` files. However, the virtual machine itself will in fact run under the regular user who invoked `sudo` in the first place (i.e. all unnecessary permissions are dropped after the disk is opened)

### Memory requirements for LUKS
- When you mount a LUKS-encrypted drive, the microVM requires at least 2.5 GiB RAM for cryptsetup to work properly. If your VM is configured with a lower amount of memory, you'll get a warning about it and the RAM configuration will be adjusted automatically. If you don't want to see the warning, set your default RAM to match this requirement (`anylinuxfs config -r <size-in-MiB>`)
- Configured amount of RAM is the maximum that can be allocated. The actual amount of memory consumed by the VM can be lower.

### NTFS
* anylinuxfs provides two different NTFS drivers
  - the user-space FUSE-based **ntfs-3g** (better compatibility)
  - the more recent kernel-space **ntfs3** (significantly better performance)
* **ntfs-3g** is used by default
* **ntfs3** can be used by specifying `-t ntfs3` option when mounting
* Important things to keep in mind
  - **ntfs3** cannot mount NTFS drives from Windows systems which were hibernated or which have Fast Startup enabled
  - **ntfs-3g** will fall back to read-only mount and issue a warning in this case
  - **ntfs3** will generally refuse to mount a drive if it has any filesystem errors
  - using any unofficial tools like `ntfsfix` to clear dirty flag will not really fix those errors and can lead to further data corruption!
  - `chkdsk` on Windows is the recommended way to fix NTFS errors
  - some users also have good experience with [`chkntfs`](https://gist.github.com/nohajc/51fdecb2dda75dd8c600173ea42b3700) by Paragon (proprietary)
  - there are permission issues reported when using **ntfs3** with Windows system drives
  - specifically, `/Program Files` some folders within `/Users` are read-only (see this [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/r325t3/permissions_problems_with_the_new_ntfs3_driver/) post for details)

**To summarize**
* There are stories online about data corruption (or system freezes) caused by the **ntfs3** driver.
* They might or might not be caused by improper use of `ntfsfix`.
* **ntfs3** is included in the mainline Linux kernel so it is considered stable. It was contributed by Paragon Software in [2021](https://www.paragon-software.com/paragon-software-announces-the-inclusion-of-its-ntfs3-driver-into-linux-kernel-5-15/).
* If you trust it, want the best performance and you're OK with inconsistent permissions on Windows system drives, use **ntfs3**
* Otherwise you're probably better of with the default and more established **ntfs-3g**

## Limitations
- Only one drive can be mounted at a time (this might be improved in the future)
- Only Apple Silicon Macs are supported (libkrun limitation)

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure nothing is running on ports 2049, 32765 and 32767. If there's another NFS server already running, `anylinuxfs` will not work.
- Check your mount flags (e.g. the `subvol` flag from demo is specific to btrfs, make sure you don't use it with other filesystems)
- Check file owner and permissions with `ls -l` and adjust accordingly. Typically, your macOS user won't have write access to your drive out of the box so you need to write files as root or first prepare a target directory writable by everyone (`chmod 777`).
- If you get `fcopyfile failed: Operation not permitted`, it can actually mean the file you're trying to copy has the quarantine attribute set (can be removed with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <filename>`)
- Accessing disks might require Full Disk Access permission (although you should get pop-ups that let you allow access case-by-case)
